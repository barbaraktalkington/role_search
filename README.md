```0 9 * * * /Users/yourname/role_search/.venv/bin/python /Users/yourname/role_search/main.py
```
### Option B: Run Daily with launchd (macOS)

2. Add a schedule (see main.py docs).
3. Load with:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.role_search.job.plist
```

### üß≠ Roadmap (Future Work)
- Add support for multiple sources (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Google Jobs API).
- Add filters (e.g., Seattle-only, exclude certain keywords).
- Send daily email/slack notifications with new job results.
- Track applications & status directly in the sheet.
